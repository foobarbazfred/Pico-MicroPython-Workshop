# Practical Edition (Day 2)
On the second day, you will create a simple system as a practical exercise. Any kind of circuit or application is fine. Use a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W) along with sensors or switches as you like. These are called the Pine Course, Bamboo Course, and Plum Course. Pine is not necessarily superior, but it is true that Pine is a bit more complicated. We will start the explanation from the simplest, Plum.

## Plum Course
- Objective: Programming focused on switches, sound, and light
- Example applications:
   - Use switches and volume controls to create various patterns of light and sound from LEDs or speakers
   - Systems focused on sound and light. Can be developed into games

## Bamboo Course
- Objective: Programming that utilizes sensors
- Example applications:
   - Use sensors such as motion sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, gyro sensors, etc.
   - Provide feedback to users with the measured data
   - Examples of display methods include using a server for gauges, LCD character displays, LED blinking patterns, and brightness changes of LEDs
   - You can also use Thonny's graphing function

## Pine Course
- Objective: Programming that utilizes networking
- Example applications:
   - Use Web APIs to get weather information and display it on an LCD or express it with a servo
   - Use MQTT for bidirectional communication with microcontrollers placed remotely. You can control LEDs and servos at remote locations

## Super Pine Course
- Objective: Prototyping an IoT system
- Example applications:
   - Upload collected sensor data to an IoT platform and visualize temperature, humidity, or human flow
   - ThingsBoard / Node-RED will be provided as IoT platforms
