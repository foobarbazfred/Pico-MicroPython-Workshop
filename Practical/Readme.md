# Practical Session (Day 2)
On the second day, as a practical session, you will create a simple system. You can choose any kind of circuit or application. Use a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W) together with sensors, switches, etc.
These are called the Matsu (Pine), Take (Bamboo), and Ume (Plum) courses. The Matsu course is not necessarily superior, but it is more complicated.

Letâ€™s start with the simplest, the Ume course.

## Ume Course
= Aim: Programming focused on switches, sound, and light
= What you can do: Use switches and volume controls to make LEDs and speakers light up or play sounds in various patterns. A system dedicated to sound and light. You can also make simple games.
## Take Course
= Aim: Programming utilizing sensors
= What you can do: Use sensors like motion sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, or gyros to perform various measurements and provide feedback to the user using the acquired data.
## Matsu Course
= Aim: Programming utilizing networks
= What you can do: Use Web APIs to get weather information and display it on an LCD or express it with a servo. Communicate bidirectionally with microcontrollers placed remotely using MQTT. For example, control LEDs at a remote location.
## Super Matsu Course
= Aim: Prototype an IoT system
= What you can do: Upload data collected by sensors to an IoT platform and visualize things like temperature/humidity or people flow. ThingsBoard is provided as the IoT platform.
