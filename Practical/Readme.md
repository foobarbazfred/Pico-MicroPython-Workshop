# Practical Session (Day 2)
On the second day, as a practical session, you will create a simple system. You can choose any kind of circuit or application. Use a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W) together with sensors, switches, etc.
These are called the Mastery (Pine) Course, Practical (Bamboo) Course, and Fundamental (Plum) courses. The Matery course is not necessarily superior, but it is more complicated.

Letâ€™s start with the simplest, the Ume course.

## Fundamental Course
= Aim: Programming focused on switches, sound, and light
= What you can do: Use switches and volume controls to make LEDs and speakers light up or play sounds in various patterns. A system dedicated to sound and light. You can also make simple games.
## Practical Course
= Aim: Programming utilizing sensors
= What you can do: Use sensors like motion sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, or gyros to perform various measurements and provide feedback to the user using the acquired data.
## Mastery Course
= Aim: Programming utilizing networks
= What you can do: Use Web APIs to get weather information and display it on an LCD or express it with a servo. Communicate bidirectionally with microcontrollers placed remotely using MQTT. For example, control LEDs at a remote location.
## Legendary Course
= Aim: Prototype an IoT system
= What you can do: Upload data collected by sensors to an IoT platform and visualize things like temperature/humidity or people flow. ThingsBoard is provided as the IoT platform.
