# Complete Training Materials Using Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython

## Seminar Overview
- Using MicroPython and Raspberry Pi Pico W, participants will create prototypes of various projects that integrate sensors and switches.
- This is a two-day course: on the first day, you will learn how to connect MicroPython with sensors and related devices, and how to build simple sensor applications.
- On the second day, the seminar is more practical; participants will form teams and design and implement applications from scratch (similar to a hands-on study session with advice).
  - Each team will first decide what to build and present their ideas, including what they want to innovate and what seems challenging.
  - For a set amount of time, members will divide tasks and collaborate to create their application. A shared drive will be provided for sharing materials.
  - If support is needed, assistance will be provided as much as possible. If direct answers are unavailable, hints will be offered.
  - After completion, each team will present their results, explaining what they improved, what was difficult, their discoveries, and what made the project interesting.
