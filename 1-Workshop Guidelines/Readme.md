### Workshop Guidelines
- Hands-on using a microcontroller with wireless capability (RPi Pico W) and an interpreter (MicroPython)
- Two-day course (Day 1 and Day 2)
- Day 1 learning objectives
  - Microcontroller basics (simple block diagrams, introduction to well-known microcontrollers)
  - Review of MicroPython/Python (assumes prior Python experience)
  - Development environment setup, tool overview, file transfer
  - Bottom-up prototyping examples using the REPL
  - Using libraries (installing modules with a package management tool)
  - Basics 1: I/O fundamentals — Digital/Analog (PWM)
  - Basics 2: Working with sensors, sensor connection methods (I2C, Serial) (SPI if possible)
  - Basics 3: Internet connectivity, using Web APIs, using MQTT
- Day 2 learning objectives
  - Prototype application development combining RPi Pico + MicroPython + sensors and various devices
  - Simple design, prototyping, and presentations
  - Team-based creation
